# RDF-DataDescriptions
This repository contains all descriptions of published data elements and vocabularies used in the StABS archival information system [scopeArchiv](https://www.scope.ch). The descriptions have been transformed in RDF in turtle-notation, to be found in the directory `data`. The directory `refine-projects` holds the exported projects from [openrefine](http://openrefine.org/) as packages. The packages contain the source data as well as the process steps.

Basic modelling has been done, using [SKOS Simple Knowledge Organization System](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/).
